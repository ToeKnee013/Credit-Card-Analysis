# Credit Card Customers Analysis

## Project Overview
*The following is a description straight from the [credit card customers](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers) website.*

A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction

Now, this dataset consists of 10,000 customers mentioning their age, salary, marital_status, credit card limit, credit card category, etc. There are nearly 18 features.

We have only 16.07% of customers who have churned. Thus, it's a bit difficult to train our model to predict churning customers.

#### This project will be broken into 6 parts through the use of a strategy found in the Google Data Analytics program.
1. **Ask:** Define the problem.
2. **Prepare:** Understand how the data was gathered and if it is credible.
3. **Process:** Create, clean, and transform data.
4. **Analyze:** Use tools to identify patterns, make predictions, recommendations and data-driven decisions.
5. **Share:** Create effective visuals, bring data to life and tell a story.
6. **Act:** Apply insights and solve problems.

## Ask
### **Primary Business Problem: Customers churning rates are increasing**
Questions we should be aiming to answer:

1. Why are customers churning?
2. Can we predict who will churn next? How?
3. What kind of demographic are we working with?

## Prepare
The data was collected by the kaggle user [Sakshi Goyal](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7) through the website URL https://leaps.analyttica.com/home. The website is used to explain how to solve a particular business problem.

Furthermore, the kaggle usability rating is an astonishing 10.0! This dataset seems to be credible and reliable.

## Process
The tools I will be working with are MySQL for transforming and surface level analysis, Tableau for visualization of findings, and Microsoft PowerPoint for sharing insights as well as a brief overview of the process. Below is a brief summary of the process.

- Created the 'credit_customers' table
- no ```NULL``` values were found
- no duplicate values were found

## Analyze
Recall our primary business problem is that customer churning rates are increasing. We can find trends in the data that may associate with the churning rates. We can ask questions based on the data such as:

1. What is the distribution of card holders based on:
   - Gender
   - Marital status
   - Age
   - Income
   - Education
   - Dependent count
   - Credit Limit
   - Average Utilization Ratio
